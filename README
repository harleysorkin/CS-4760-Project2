Overview:
This program forks off a given number of child processes worker.c from oss.c, each of which accesses shared memory created by oss.c. This shared memory represents a clock, with the leading number being seconds and the latter number being nanoseconds. Each worker will attempt to increase the clock by a given amount.

Invocation:
./oss -h -n -s -m

-h displays the help message and invocation instructions
-n sets the number of workers to create
-s sets the number of workers allowed to be execed at a time
-m sets the number of times and the amount to increment the clock by
